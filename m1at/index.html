            <p>Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs with LEDs, got a new fridge and super-efficient heat
            pump and youre still paying around $1200 a year? Your next step is to let HT Green work with you to design and install a
            system that uses solar, wind or geothermal that's guaranteed to wipe that power bill for now and into the future. </p>

                <p>Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is warmer than
                the air and we can use this to heat your home. HT Green can engineer a solution
                to fit your situation to give you free plentiful home warming energy year-round.
                <br>
                <br>
                Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally friendly, but
                has previously been geographically limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries.
                Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable
                resources, especially for direct applications such as home heating.
                
                <br>
                <br>

                Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but
                these emissions are much lower than those of conventional fossil fuels. As a result,
                geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed
                instead of fossil fuels.</p>
